    "# 1: Physics Introduction\n",

    "## The Scope of Physics\n",
    "> Science consists of theories and laws that are the general truths of nature, as well as the body of knowledge they encompass. Scientists are continuously trying to expand this body of knowledge and to perfect the expression of the laws that describe it. Physics, which comes from the Greek phúsis, meaning “nature,” is concerned with describing the interactions of energy, matter, space, and time to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that underlie every phenomenon. This concern for describing the basic phenomena in nature essentially defines the scope of physics.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Physics aims to understand the world around us at the most basic level. It emphasizes the use of a small number of quantitative laws to do this, which can be useful to other fields pushing the performance boundaries of existing technologies.\n",

    "## Scale and Orders of Magnitude\n",
    ">The order of magnitude of a number is the power of 10 that most closely approximates it. Thus, the order of magnitude refers to the scale (or size) of a value. Each power of 10 represents a different order of magnitude. For example, 101,102,103, and so forth, are all different orders of magnitude, as are 100=1,10−1,10−2, and 10−3. To find the order of magnitude of a number, take the base-10 logarithm of the number and round it to the nearest integer, then the order of magnitude of the number is simply the resulting power of 10. For example, the order of magnitude of 800 is 103 because log10800≈2.903, which rounds to 3. Similarly, the order of magnitude of 450 is 103 because log10450≈2.653, which rounds to 3 as well. Thus, we say the numbers 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude: 103. However, the order of magnitude of 250 is 102 because log10250≈2.397, which rounds to 2.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> An equivalent but quicker way to find the order of magnitude of a number is first to write it in scientific notation and then check to see whether the first factor is greater than or less than 10−−√=100.5≈3. The idea is that 10−−√=100.5 is halfway between 1=100 and 10=101 on a log base-10 scale. Thus, if the first factor is less than 10−−√, then we round it down to 1 and the order of magnitude is simply whatever power of 10 is required to write the number in scientific notation. On the other hand, if the first factor is greater than 10−−√, then we round it up to 10 and the order of magnitude is one power of 10 higher than the power needed to write the number in scientific notation. For example, the number 800 can be written in scientific notation as 8×102. Because 8 is bigger than 10−−√≈3, we say the order of magnitude of 800 is 102+1=103. The number 450 can be written as 4.5×102, so its order of magnitude is also 103 because 4.5 is greater than 3. However, 250 written in scientific notation is 2.5×102 and 2.5 is less than 3, so its order of magnitude is 102.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The order of magnitude of a number is designed to be a ballpark estimate for the scale (or size) of its value. It is simply a way of rounding numbers consistently to the nearest (on a logarithmic scale) power of 10. In other words, if numbers differ by one order of magnitude, the one is larger than the other by about ten. This makes doing rough mental math with very big and very small numbers easier. For example, the diameter of a hydrogen atom is on the order of 10−10 m, whereas the diameter of the Sun is on the order of 109 m, so it would take roughly 109/10−10=1019 hydrogen atoms to stretch across the diameter of the Sun. This is much easier to do in your head than using the more precise values of 1.06×10−10m for a hydrogen atom diameter and 1.39×109m for the Sun’s diameter, to find that it would take 1.31×1019 hydrogen atoms to stretch across the Sun’s diameter. In addition to being easier, the rough estimate is also nearly as informative as the precise calculation.\n",

    "## SI Units: Base and Derived\n",
    ">In any system of units, the units for some physical quantities must be defined through a measurement process. These are called the base quantities for that system and their units are the system’s base units. All other physical quantities can then be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base quantities. Each of these physical quantities is then known as a derived quantity and each unit is called a derived unit. The choice of base quantities is somewhat arbitrary, as long as they are independent of each other and all other quantities can be derived from them. Typically, the goal is to choose physical quantities that can be measured accurately to a high precision as the base quantities. The reason for this is simple. Since the derived units can be expressed as algebraic combinations of the base units, they can only be as accurate and precise as the base units from which they are derived.\n",
